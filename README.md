You can firstly scan through the [ipython notebook](main.ipynb) to get an overview of the preliminary experiments.

Steps:
1. install `python3` and related packages
2. init submodules.
   1. The btor2 benchmark is over 1G, be patient.  
   2. Further build btor2c as in its README
3. follow the steps in the notebook
   1. You may need to change the proxy settings in the notebook
